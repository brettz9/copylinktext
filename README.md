# CopyLinkText

Repo for restartless [Copy Link Text Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/copy-link-text-4750/).

## Possible user-facing to-dos

1.  Could try to make work with main browser XUL

2.  Optional ability to get input type hidden, optgroup text?,
    get form and form control names?

3.  Move non-links/img alt text retrieval to separate add-on?

4.  Make option to grab label text for elements

5.  Revisit image copying and password copying (to avoid showing what
    is being copied)

6.  Resubmit to Babelzilla to ensure new items are also localized

7.  Localize title and description of add-on itself?
