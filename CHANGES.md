# 1.4.3

-   Disable feature for all regular textboxes; no real need anyways and
    could conflict with some features like select-all or paste

-   Since 1.4.2, reenabling for other input fields except for password
    when text is selected (though users may still wish to disable for
    password fields for security or to be able to select-all/paste into
    the field)

# 1.4.2

-   Setting accessFormControls to false by default

-   Only allow form controls right-click to override default
    if the user has not selected text within the input field;
    this should, for some users, actually allow accessFormControls
    to be always turned on (unless a webpage has its own
   right-click handlers which is very rare)

-   My apologies to my users for not having anticipated
    conflicts here with right-click inside content areas;
    I really believe you can even turn accessFormControls back on,
    now but to be safe, I've turned it off by default for new
    users; if the setting doesn't get turned off for you, just go to
    Tools->Addons->Copy Link Text->Options and turn off one or both
    of the options; but I hope you will try it on because I
    think this should now let you have access to the new functionality
    without conflict with pre-existing functionality
    Please feel free to report any issues or requests on my blog:
